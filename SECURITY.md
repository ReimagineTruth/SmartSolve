# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

At SmartSolve, we prioritize the security of our platform and the safety of our users within the Pi Network ecosystem. This landing page (`index.html` and related files) is a static site, but we are committed to addressing any security concerns promptly and transparently. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us so we can take appropriate action.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JS project, there are no specific "versions" of the landing page. However, we ensure that the latest deployment of the SmartSolve landing page is secure and up-to-date with best practices.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a security vulnerability in the SmartSolve landing page (e.g., XSS risks, insecure dependencies, or other issues), please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please refrain from sharing the vulnerability in public forums, such as GitHub issues, until we have had the chance to address it.
2. **Email Us**: Send a detailed report to our security team at `security@smartsolve.example.com` (replace with the actual email address once set up). Include the following details:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, user harm).
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations (optional).
3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and aim to provide a resolution timeline within **7 business days**.
4. **Collaboration**: We may reach out to you for additional details or to collaborate on a fix.

## Security Best Practices in This Project

The SmartSolve landing page follows these security best practices:

- **No Client-Side Secrets**: This static site does not store API keys, credentials, or sensitive data in the client-side code.
- **Sanitized Inputs**: While this is a static site, any future dynamic features (e.g., forms) will sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Secure Dependencies**: External libraries (e.g., Font Awesome) are loaded via trusted CDNs with integrity checks where possible.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: When deployed, the site should be served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
- **Pi SDK Integration**: The placeholder for Pi SDK integration (`Pi.authenticate()`) will follow best practices outlined in [xAI’s API documentation](https://x.ai/api) once implemented.
