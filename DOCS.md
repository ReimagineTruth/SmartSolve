## Troubleshooting

### The "Sign in with Pi" button doesn’t work.
- The "Sign in with Pi" button is currently a placeholder. It will trigger an alert until the Pi SDK is fully integrated. Refer to [xAI’s API documentation](https://x.ai/api) for implementation details.

### The page doesn’t display correctly on my device.
- Ensure you’re using a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Check your internet connection, as external resources (e.g., Font Awesome, Google Fonts) require loading.
- If the issue persists, contact us at `support@smartsolve.example.com`.

### I can’t find a specific feature on the landing page.
- The landing page is a pre-login experience and focuses on introducing SmartSolve. Post-login features (e.g., adding tasks, tracking expenses) will be available after signing in.
